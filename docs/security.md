# Security

## Overview

TermBeam provides access to a real shell on your machine. **Security is critical.**

## Threat Model

TermBeam is designed for **trusted local networks**. It is NOT designed as a production-grade remote access tool. Use with caution when exposing to the internet.

## Security Features

### Authentication

- Password-based authentication via `--password` or `--generate-password`
- Tokens are cryptographically random (32 bytes, hex-encoded)
- Tokens expire after 24 hours
- Stored in httpOnly cookies (not accessible via JavaScript)
- Cookie uses `sameSite: lax` to prevent CSRF
- Cookie `secure` flag is off (tokens sent over HTTP for localhost compatibility)

### Rate Limiting

- Login endpoint limited to **5 attempts per minute** per IP
- Returns HTTP 429 when exceeded

### HTTP Security Headers

Every response includes:

| Header                   | Value           | Purpose               |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | --------------------- |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff`       | Prevent MIME sniffing |
| `X-Frame-Options`        | `DENY`          | Prevent clickjacking  |
| `X-XSS-Protection`       | `1; mode=block` | XSS filter            |
| `Referrer-Policy`        | `no-referrer`   | No referrer leaks     |

### Network Binding

- **Default:** Binds to `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces, LAN-accessible)
- Use `--host 127.0.0.1` to restrict to localhost only
- The tunnel feature handles TLS via Azure DevTunnels

## Best Practices

!!! danger "Never Run Without a Password on a Public Network"
Without authentication, anyone on the network can access your terminal with your user permissions.

1. **Always use a password** — prefer `--generate-password` for strong random passwords
2. **Use `--host 127.0.0.1`** if you don't need LAN access
3. **Use tunnels carefully** — they make your terminal publicly accessible
4. **Close TermBeam when done** — it's not a daemon, don't leave it running
5. **Use on trusted networks** — TermBeam is not designed for hostile environments

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you find a security vulnerability, please email the maintainers directly rather than opening a public issue. See the repository for contact details.
