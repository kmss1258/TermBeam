TermBeam lets you access your terminal from a phone, tablet, or any browser — no SSH, no port forwarding, no config files. Run one command and scan the QR code.

I built this because I kept needing to run quick commands on my dev machine while away from my desk, and SSH on a phone is painful. TermBeam gives you a real terminal with a touch-friendly UI that actually works on small screens.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx termbeam
```

Or install globally:

```bash
npm install -g termbeam
termbeam
```

Scan the QR code printed in your terminal, or open the URL on any device.

### Secure by default

TermBeam starts with a tunnel and auto-generated password out of the box — just run `termbeam` and scan the QR code.

```bash
termbeam                        # tunnel + auto-password (default)
termbeam --password mysecret    # use a specific password
termbeam --no-tunnel            # LAN-only (no tunnel)
termbeam --no-password          # disable password protection
```

## Features

- **Mobile-first UI** with on-screen touch bar (arrow keys, Tab, Enter, Ctrl shortcuts, Esc) and touch-optimized controls
- **Copy/paste support** — Copy button opens text overlay for finger-selectable terminal content; Paste button with clipboard API + fallback modal
- **Image paste** — paste images from clipboard, uploaded to server
- **Tabbed multi-session terminal** — open, switch, and manage multiple sessions from a single tab bar with drag-to-reorder
- **Split view** — view two sessions side-by-side (horizontal on desktop, vertical on mobile)
- **Session colors** — assign a color to each session for quick identification
- **Activity indicators** — see how recently each session had output (e.g. "3s ago", "5m ago")
- **Tab previews** — hover (desktop) or long-press (mobile) a tab to preview the last few lines of output
- **Side panel** (mobile) — slide-out session list with output previews for quick switching
- **Create sessions anywhere** — new session modal available from both the hub page and the terminal page
- **Touch scrolling** — swipe to scroll through terminal history
- **Share button** — share the TermBeam URL via Web Share API, clipboard, or legacy copy fallback (works over HTTP); each share gets a fresh single-use auto-login link
- **QR code auto-login** — scan the QR code to log in automatically without typing the password (one-time token, 5-minute expiry)
- **Refresh button** — clear PWA/service worker cache and reload to get the latest version
- **iPhone PWA safe area** — full support for `viewport-fit=cover` and safe area insets on notched devices
- **Password auth** with token-based cookies and rate-limited login
- **Folder browser** to pick working directories without typing paths
- **Initial command** — optionally launch a session straight into `htop`, `vim`, or any command
- **Shell detection** — auto-detects your shell on all platforms (PowerShell, cmd, bash, zsh, Git Bash, WSL)
- **QR code on startup** for instant phone connection
- **Light/dark theme** with persistent preference
- **Adjustable font size** via status bar controls, saved across sessions
- **Remote access via [DevTunnel](#remote-access)** — ephemeral or persisted public URLs

## Remote Access

```bash
# Tunnel is on by default
termbeam

# Persisted tunnel (stable URL you can bookmark, reused across restarts, 30-day expiry)
termbeam --persisted-tunnel

# LAN-only (no tunnel)
termbeam --no-tunnel
```

Requires the [Dev Tunnels CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started):

- **Windows:** `winget install Microsoft.devtunnel`
- **macOS:** `brew install --cask devtunnel`
- **Linux:** `curl -sL https://aka.ms/DevTunnelCliInstall | bash`

Persisted tunnels save a tunnel ID to `~/.termbeam/tunnel.json` so the URL stays the same between sessions.

## CLI Reference

```bash
termbeam [shell] [args...]        # start with a specific shell (default: auto-detect)
termbeam --port 8080              # custom port (default: 3456)
termbeam --host 127.0.0.1        # restrict to localhost (default: 0.0.0.0)
```

Environment variables: `PORT`, `TERMBEAM_PASSWORD`, `TERMBEAM_CWD`, `TERMBEAM_LOG_LEVEL`, `SHELL` (Unix fallback), `COMSPEC` (Windows fallback). See [Configuration docs](https://dorlugasigal.github.io/TermBeam/configuration/).

## Security

TermBeam auto-generates a password and creates a tunnel by default, so your terminal is protected out of the box. Be aware that the tunnel exposes your terminal to the internet — use `--no-tunnel` for LAN-only access, or `--host 127.0.0.1` to restrict to your machine only.

Auth uses secure httpOnly cookies with 24-hour expiry, login is rate-limited to 5 attempts per minute, and security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.) are set on all responses. The QR code on startup embeds a one-time token (OTT) for password-free login — the token is single-use and expires after 5 minutes. API clients that can't use cookies can authenticate with an `Authorization: Bearer <password>` header. See the [Security Guide](https://dorlugasigal.github.io/TermBeam/security/) for more.
